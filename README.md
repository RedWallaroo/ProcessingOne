Processing - Visualizer

This quick app was developed using Processing and the Krister.ees library.  This is only a small piece of the project
I'm envisioning but if you are looking for a basic music visualizer, please feel free to use this code.

On the other hand, if you would like to further develop this, here a list of things 'to do':

- Add spiral rotation to graphics
- Adjust draw() ranges so that it applies to various genres/music styles.
- Enable song metadata information to display at the bottom of the visualization.
- Add/Allow for 'SAVE' (saves final image as a high res.) Might need a button that gets enabled once the song has 
  finished playing.

Also, this app will eventually go on a webpage where users will be able to:

- Create user account / login/logout.
- Search for stream of song they would like to use.
- Basic personalization of the visual (maybe colors and such.)
- Save/Download image 
- Order/Purchase high res. visualization on a canvas.
